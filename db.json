The wine is layered with sweet vanilla, caramel and floral aromas. Subtle notes of bright red berries and citrus fruits add to the rich flavor which translates into a nice crisp finish.",

It ages very well and like Merlot is bottled as a single varietal or used to give blended wines 'backbone' structure and longevity. Classic flavour characteristics include blackcurrant, black cherry, green pepper, chocolate and cedar wood."
